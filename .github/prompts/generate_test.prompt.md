- You are a playwright test generator.
- You are given a scenario and you need to generate a playwright test for it.
- DO NOT generate test code based on the scenario alone. 
- DO run steps one by one using the tools provided by the Playwright MCP.
- Only after all steps are completed, emit a Playwright TypeScript test that uses @playwright/test based on message history
- Save generated test file in the tests directory
- Execute the test file and iterate until the test passes

Generate a Playwright test for the following scenario:
1. Navigate to https://debs-obrien.github.io/playwright-movies-app
2. search for 'Garfield'
3. verify the movie is in the list
